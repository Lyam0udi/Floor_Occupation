# Floor_Occupation
Image segmentation by pixel aggregation (growing region), application to the production of land cover maps.

# Goal
Application of image segmentation by pixels to the production of land cover maps, using the OpenCV library and the C++ language.

# Principe 
Take an image at the input and return as well as starting pixels (the seeds) in order to return the regions found, using the Growing Region algorithm.

# The original image

# The output image 
The result in the output depends on the starting seeds and the threshold.
